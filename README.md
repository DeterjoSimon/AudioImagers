# AudioImagers
Project for the Computers and Music course at EPFL. We plan on doing some fun stuff with sound and with images. 

# Running the demo
To run our demo, you only need to run all cells from the General_pipeline notebook.
There is all our effect inside the notebook including examples and description.

At the end of the notebook, there is a small user interface to let you choose a sound, effect and image so that you can have your own experience.
